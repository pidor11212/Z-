```

🚀 Features

✅ Variables

```
set x = 10
set y = x * 2 + 5
```

✅ Direct arithmetic in console

```
> 2 + 2 * 2
= 6
```

✅ Conditions (if/elif/else)

```
if x > 10
    s(More than ten)
elif x == 10
    s(Exactly ten)
else
    s(Less than ten)
endif
```

✅ User input (like Python's input)

```
Ask How old are you?
print result
```

✅ Output text

```
s(Hello, world!)
s(The value of x is {x})
```

✅ Mathematical functions

```
fib 10     # Fibonacci numbers
fact 5     # factorial
prime 17   # prime number check
```

✅ Performance counting

```
count to 1000000
speed
bench
```

✅ Built-in constants

· pi = 3.14159
· e = 2.71828
· answer = 42
